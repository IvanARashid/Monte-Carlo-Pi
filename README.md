# Monte-Carlo-Pi
Estimates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo Method.

The script produces and saves a gif that uses 1000 iterations to estimate the value of pi. The number of iterations can be changed by changing the value of the "N" variable.

This project is my "Hello World!" of Monte Carlo simulations.
